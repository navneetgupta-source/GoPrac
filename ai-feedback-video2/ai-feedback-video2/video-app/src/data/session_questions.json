Two, you did not check InventoryHelper or tag helpers for stale reads. Three, you left out mentioning the no-stale-read business rule explicitly in your notes. Lets break down the mistakes in next slide.",
      "thinking_advice": "Lets analyze your thinking process step by step. Step one is Locate mismatch, where you should trace finalStock from OrderService through OrderServlet to the JSP and confirm no stale reads happen. Step two is Validate rules, where you should restate the no-stale-read rule and test helper tags for compliance. Step three is Inspect fallbacks, where you should check OrderServlet conditional overwrites and stale inventory state when updates fail. Now lets see How You Thought. For Locate mismatch, you identified the OrderService vs JSP mismatch, but you did not document intermediate overwrites. My advice is that you should trace finalStock from service to JSP and ensure no stale reads. For Validate rules, you mentioned recomputation risk, but you did not cite the specific rule or helper tag. My advice is that you should confirm the no-stale-read rule and test helper tags for compliance. For Inspect fallbacks, you raised the stale inventory idea, but you skipped checking servlet-level fallbacks. My advice is that you should inspect servlet conditionals and stale inventory state on update failures. I would also advice you to go through the concepts of: Variable Tracing, Business Rule Validation, and Fallback Logic.",
